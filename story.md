# Dailymotion Story

To use Dailymotion Story you must create a player first through [Partner HQ](https://www.dailymotion.com/partner/x1wzpns/embed/players) and get the `{PLAYER_ID}`.
> Set the player's Aspect ratio as `9:16` in the player creation menu.

> Disable First-time viewable, Automatic recommendations, Autonext, player controls, and PIP from player settings

> Set player "AutoStart" on

You also need to create or find a playlist to embed for your story. Learn more on [how to create, sort, feed and embed playlists](https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003674799-Playlist). When you are finished, add the `{PLAYLIST_ID}` to your embed code below.

### Start Embedding

You need to do 2 things to embed the Player.

1. Put the [script](https://srvr.dmvs-apac.com/dm-story/dm-story.min.js) at the very bottom before the `body` ends in your website
```js
<script src="https://srvr.dmvs-apac.com/dm-story/dm-story.min.js"></script>
```
3. Add `<div class="dm-story" `[{PARAMS}](#parameters-available)`></div>` in your target body content.


### Standard Embed Tag

```html
<div class="dm-story" playlistId="{PLAYLIST_ID}" playerId="{PLAYER_ID}" ></div>
```

### Parameters Available

| Name | Type | Description |
| :---: | :---: | --- |
| playlistId <br /> `Mandatory` | string | Set playlist `xid` directly to the tag to embed playlist|
| PlayerId <br /> `Mandatory` | string | You can get `{PLAYER_ID}` from [Dailymotion partner HQ](https://www.dailymotion.com/partner/embed/players) in the player tab, inside the embed menu. |
| numOfVideos | number | To specify the number of videos in the playlist. Default value: `7` |
| baseStyle | string | You can set the base styling of your video thumbnail gallery. The default value is `carousel`  i.e., thumbnails will show as a carousel. Or you can set it to `grid` style. To visualize the effects, please check [examples below](#example-links)|
| thumbnail | string | You can set thumbnail resolution. Available values are [here](https://developers.dailymotion.com/api/#playlist-thumbnail_60_url-field). By default, it is `thumbnail_480_url`|
| customConfig | string | To add advertising Config to pass unique keys for advertising purposes. You can add multiple values. See the embed example below. |

### Embed Example :
```html
<div class="dm-story"
   playerId="xxxx"
   numOfVideos="10"
   baseStyle="carousel"
   thumbnail="thumbnail_360_url"
   customConfig="[dynamiciu]=23328537%2FAdParams_Test;[keyvalues]=category%3Dsports%26section%3Dvideo"
></div>
```
In the sample above for customConfig value, you realized there are text %2f, %3d, and %26. All of that number is a URL encoding. Thatâ€™s a character of /, =, and &. You can visit this URL encoding link for a complete list.

### Features:
- The Dailymotion Story also provides a feature to add CTA (Call to Action) button over the content video. To add CTA button you need to add `<script type="application/json" id="dm_story_text">` tag before [embed code for Stories](#start-embedding). Data for CTA button can be set inside `<script type="application/json">` as JSON format. Here is an example,
```html
<script type="application/json" id="dm_story_text">
  {
    "x8cjx3c" : {
      "cta_card" :{
        "text": "Read the article",
        "link": "www.example.com"
      }
    },
    "x8cjx34" : {
      "cta_card" :{
        "text": "Explore more",
        "link": "www.example3.com"
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```
> CTA buttons are implemented in [the example pages](#example-links) as a demo.

- To change the default height of thumbnails, we provide a CSS variable `--dm-item-height`. By default, it is set to `230px` for the carousel and `400px` for the grid base style.
```css
.dm-story{
    --dm-item-height : 200px;
}
```

- You can change the SVG of the share and mute buttons by a predefined CSS variable.
    - `--dmstory-share-button-path` to update the share button
    - `--dmstory-muteoff-button-path` to update the mute-off button
    - `--dmstory-muteon-button-path` to update the mute-on button
```css
.dm-story{
    --dmstory-muteoff-button-path : path('M3 9v6h4l5 5V4L7 9H3zm13.5 3c0-1.77-1.02-3.29-2.5-4.03v8.05c1.48-.73 2.5-2.25 2.5-4.02zM14 3.23v2.06c2.89.86 5 3.54 5 6.71s-2.11 5.85-5 6.71v2.06c4.01-.91 7-4.49 7-8.77s-2.99-7.86-7-8.77z');
}
```
- You can modify the style of many features/buttons by selecting classes. For more Please contact [DPS team](professional-services@dailymotion.com).
```css
/*Changing color of CTA button */
.dm-story .dm-story-cta-button{
    background: #ae3a0c !important;
}
```

### Setting `customConfig` dynamically: 

Dailymotion story provides a way to set two different `customCofig` based on the position of the video in the story. Bbove the example shows how it can be achieved
```html
<script type="application/json" id="dm_story_text">
  {
      "customConfig":{
         "value": "[premium]=true",
         "position": [2,4,7,10]
       }
  }
</script>
<div class="dm-story" playlistId="x6hzyp" numOfVideos="10" playerId="xfgl5" customConfig="[premium]=false"></div> 
```
As you can see in the embed code, `"[premium]=false"` is the default value of customConfig for all videos in the story. `"[premium]=true"` will be applied to those videos having positions `2`, `4` and so on. The position of the first video of the story is always considered `1`.
We have a (demo)[https://staging.dmvs-apac.com/dmStory/lab/carousel_adtest.html] in staging with the above configuration. Please contact us[Professional-Services
